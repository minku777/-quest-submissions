1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

Safety and Security.
Clarity.
Approachability.
Developer Experience.
Resource Oriented Programming.

2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?

Safety and SecurityÅ®It is very important to be safe and secure because you do not know anything. I'm very worried about using it if it's not safe.
ClarityÅ®The code is easy to read, which makes it very safe to check, easy to manage, less likely to make mistakes, and more efficient.
ApproachabilityÅ®If it is even remotely similar to other programming, you can use that programming experience to make a smooth transition.
Developer ExperienceÅ®Debugging is a must, and it makes the work very efficient to see errors clearly and immediately.
